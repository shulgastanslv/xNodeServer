## Overview
xNode is a behavior tree framework designed for creating, managing, and executing behavior trees in Python. It provides a flexible and modular approach for defining complex decision-making processes through various types of nodes, including ActionNode, ConditionNode, SequenceNode, SelectorNode, and ParallelNode.

This repository also includes a Flask-based web application that allows you to interact with and manage behavior trees via a web interface. The Flask server supports functionalities like creating behavior trees, adding actions, running trees, and viewing their structure.
